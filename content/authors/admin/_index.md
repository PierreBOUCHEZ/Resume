    institution: University of Tours
    date_start: 2020-10-01
    date_end: Presently
    summary: |
      This thesis project revolves around the ageing process and the reliability of a new generation of probes using the CMUT technology. The understanding of the failure mechanisms will enable the determination of a behavioral law of the most sensitive physical parameters of the device as a function of its operating period and conditions.

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
